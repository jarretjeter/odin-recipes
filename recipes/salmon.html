        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A quick and simple way to prepare wild salmon.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 (3 ounce) fillets salmon, with skin</li>
                <li>sea salt to taste </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse the salmon fillets and pat dry thoroughly with paper towels; season with sea salt.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Gently lay the salmon into the hot oil with the skin side facing up and cook until the the flesh side is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes; turn and continue cooking until the skin side is slightly browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove the salmon from the skillet, allowing any oil to drain from the fish back into the pan.</li>
                <li>Remove the skin from the salmon fillets; fry the skin in the oil remaining in the skillet until crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve the crispy skin with the salmon.</li>
