        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Denver omelet is known for its firmer texture and caramelized flavor. <br>Make it a complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter </li>
                <li>¼ cup diced smoked ham </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons diced onion </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper </li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>⅓ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat eggs until just combined; do not over-beat.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a skillet over high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper. Sprinkle in a nice pinch of salt and a touch of pepper. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until onions start to soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in the eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed. Quickly run the spatula along the edges of the omelet.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over the omelet. Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. Fold omelet in half with your spatula and transfer to a plate.</li>
            </ol>
